## General info
The workflow of the model looks like this: Train offline -> Make model available as a service -> Predict online. 
Steps involved:
1. A classifier is trained offline with spam and non-spam messages.
2. The trained model is then deployed as a web service to serve users.

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.5
* sklearn




## Process

* I will be using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset which tags 5,574 text messages based on whether they are “spam” or “ham” (not spam).
* Build a classification model using Naive Bayes Classifier to classify which texts are spam.
* I used Naive Bayes Classifier because they are popular statistical technique for e-mail filtering.
* Turned the spam message classifier model into a web application using FLASK



## Features
* The model classifier classifies the input message in spam or non-spam with an accuracy of 93% 

The end product looks like this:
